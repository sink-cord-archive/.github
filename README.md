# Yellowsink's Discord Modding Archive

Hi, I'm [Yellowsink](https://github.com/yellowsink).

I wrote quite a lot of Discord modding stuff. Mostly for [Cumcord](https://github.com/cumcord).

This archive is a place for my discontinued projects to go :)

Massive thanks to all who used my Cumcord plugins, I hope I could make your day to day use of Discord more enjoyable :)
